    /* Introduces a new type of semaphore that has an integer
       payload identifying a point in a timeline.
       Such timeline semaphores support the following operations:
        * Host query - A host operation that allows querying
          the payload of the timeline semaphore.
        * Host wait - A host operation that allows a blocking
          wait for a timeline semaphore to reach a specified value.
        * Host signal - A host operation that allows advancing
          the timeline semaphore to a specified value.
        * Device wait - A device operation that allows waiting
          for a timeline semaphore to reach a specified value.
        * Device signal - A device operation that allows advancing
          the timeline semaphore to a specified value. */
