       It introduces the idea of private data slots as a means
       of storing a 64-bit unsigned integer of application
       defined data. Private data slots can be created or
       destroyed any time an associated device is available.
       Private data slots can be reserved at device creation time,
       and limiting use to the amount reserved will allow the
       extension to exhibit better performance characteristics. */
